# Contact List App! 

I made this project to demonstrate the skils of buildings a PERN stack application. 

## Project Objective:

This project utilizes a backend server, created with Express.js. Making calls to an API, displaying the data to the frontend.

## Technologies used

React 
Express.js
Node.js
PostgreSQL
VSCode 
Tailwind CSS

## Installation Instructions

2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the cloned repository in a code editor.


### Environment setup: 

cd server and run 

`````````
